                <p class="subtitle">Third-year Physics Ph.D. candidate at University of Washington</p>
                <p>Hi! I'm Miles, a PhD candidate studying experimental, high energy, particle, physics. I'm interested in all things physics, in particular computational and mathematical physics and machine learning applications to fundamental experiment. Primarily, I am an experimentalist but am always looking to expand my horizons.</p>

        <section class="about-content">
            <p>Currently, I am affiliated with the <a href="https://atlas.cern">ATLAS</a> collaboration at <a href="https://www.home.cern">CERN</a> through the University of Washington. The analysis I work on is focused on tau leptons; in particular, I am part of the team measuring the $H \to \tau\tau$ cross-section in the boosted regime and in measuring spin correlations in the $Z \to \tau\tau$ decay channel. Previously, I worked on the legacy Run 2 $H \rightarrow \tau\tau$ cross-section measurement and on algorithm development for $\tau$ energy scale calibration at the ATLAS experiment using a novel Mixture-Density-Network approach.</p>

            <p>I am currently funded by the <a href="https://watchep.org">WATCHEP fellowship</a> which provides two years of funding for research in computation related to high-energy particle physics. For this fellowship, I am working on various implementations of particle tracking as-a-service. This includes GPU acceleration as-a-service with an <a href="https://github.com/milescb/traccc-aaS/tree/main">implementation</a> of the existing tracking library <a href="https://github.com/acts-project/traccc">traccc</a> and GNN as-a-service for the <a href="https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/papers/11414/files/1342-CHEP2023_GNN4ITK.pdf">GNN4ITk project</a>.</p>
